# Project-Sarica-v3
The third iteration of the self aware general intelligence project.

## What is it?
Project Sarica is my personal attempt at creating an artificial intelligance agent that is capable of learning on it's own, making it's own choices, and even assigning it's own goals to strive for. This started out as a simple thought experiment I had recently that has, at least in my mind, shown some potential for growth.

## Where are versions v1 and v2?
Versions 1 and 2 of this project were concepts I designed back when I was still in high school and was extremely new to artificial intelligence. They were barely capable of simple genetic algorithm based learning, and often failed at even that. They were also more like libraries than actual singular projects.
