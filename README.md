# Project-Sarica-v3
The third iteration of the self aware general intelligence project.

## What is it?
Project Sarica is my personal attempt at creating an artificial intelligance agent that is capable of learning on it's own, making it's own choices, and even assigning it's own goals to strive for. This started out as a simple thought experiment I had recently that has, at least in my mind, shown some potential for growth.

## Where are versions v1 and v2?
Versions 1 and 2 of this project were concepts I designed back when I was still in high school and was extremely new to artificial intelligence. They were barely capable of simple genetic algorithm based learning, and often failed at even that. They were also more like libraries than actual singular projects.

## What is Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)?
There is no hard definition of Artificial General Intelligence, but the general concept is a machine learning agent that is capable of preforming more advanced tasks and problem solving in a human-like manner. Fo the purpose of the repository, an AGI is defined as any machine learning agent meeting all of the following criteria:

* The agent is capable of retaining and applying any obtainable information or knowledge available within it's given environment. This does not mean all information needs to be obtained at once, just the ability to obtain it.

* Observing and overseeing it's own growth and making corrections based on this feedback.

* Assigning it's own subgoals based on only known knowledge, and making attempts towards completing those goals.

Any machine learning agent that follows this criteria is considered an AGI for the purposes of this repository. Agents that are capable of meeting these to higher degrees are considered more advanced agents.

## Where does the name Sarica come from?
Sarica is the name of a fictional character from a book I started to write back in highschool. The character was a self aware AI from a highly advanced video game, designed for the purpose of being a moderator to keep players in check, that became curious about our world.

## Is this project open source?
Yes, this project is open source. If you wish to make an edit, you may do do on another branch. Though it is requested you message me about it first before any edits are made.

## Who can use this software?
This software is open source and is available for free for all users. Any edits can be made via forking, or branching mentioned above.

There is currently no available releases for this software, so if you wish to use it, you must download and compile it yourself. Release binaries will be distributed once the software ha reached a stable version.
