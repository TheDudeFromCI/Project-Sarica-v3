## Instincts

### 10/15/17

Instincts, in the context of this project, refer to the known knowledge prior to the operation of the consiousness loop. In laymans terms, this means that any hard coded or learned information inside of an agent before it has be given the option to learn on it's own is considered instictual. This means that any machine learning agents that are never given a conciousness loop are considered instictual agents. Thus, all "weak" intelligence algorithms full under this category.

This terminology is important for several reasons. First, instictual information is present right from the initiation of the agent before it even begins it's learning process. Any information that is present is likely to remain with the agent for an extended period of time. This is also extremely important for guiding the agent through the learning process. An agent with a consiousness loop may attempt to spend much of it's inital life time simply trying to figure out the controls. This has a major hinderence of the operation of the agent. On the other hand, an agent with basic controls and environmental understanding insticts may begin the learning process almost immediatly. In addition, the same insticts may be applied to multiple agents to rapidly decress training time. A single network may be trained instictually under it has a basic grasp of it's environment and it's moral guidelines. This single network can then be instanced any number of times and each give a custom consiousness loop where they could futher develop their own behaviours and personalities.

Instinctual networks are also important for the fact that they are extremely fast. A single well-trained deep neural network may identify a cat in an image in just a few milliseconds, while a consious agent may take a signifigant period of time. (Having to obtain it's objective, learn how to obtain it's objective, and finally work through the process of actually identifying it.) This being said, it is imparative for a consious agent to have multiple instinctual networks at it's disposal for bringing even minor tasks back into a reasonable operation time frame.
