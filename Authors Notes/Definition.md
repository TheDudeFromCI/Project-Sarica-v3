## Definition

### 10/17/17
A definition is the context of this repository, refers to a specific type of weak AI. The AI is any form of feed-forward neural network that types in sensory input neurons and outputs a single neuron. This output neuron refers to how similarly the sensory input is to the object that is being defined.

For example, a Visual Cat Definition is a feed-forward neural network (Most likely a CNN) that takes visualâ€‹ pixel inputs and returns a value from. 0-1 on how likely the image is to contain a cat. This network has, in essence, defined what a cat looks like.

These types of networks are important for the purpose that that can be trained very quickly through current means and cloned infinitely. Each clone can be downloaded and installed into an AGI for them to instantly learn what a cat is, without the need for explicit training. While this process is less computationally efficient than simply training everything into a single network, it is highly portable and can be applied to large numbers of agents to train the with general knowledge quickly.

The sensory input values can be any type of input that the agent is capable or perceiving. This includes things such as visual, audio, networking, mental thoughts, emotions, etc.
